        <p>The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table,
             but only with the columns that we requested.

            If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table,
             we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.</p>
